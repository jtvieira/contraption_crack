##########CONVENTIONS TO BE USED THROUGHOUT THIS PROJECT################
***It is best to stick a common set of conventions so that way our work is synchronized and there are minimal problems***

    ###GIT###
    If you need any help with any of this contact me (Joe)
    - For each task, create a new branch and keep your work within that branch
    - Create a Pull Request after completion of each task.
    - Commit your code frequently

    ###Coding practices###
    - Encapsulate fields
    - Each method should do one thing... if you need to do multiple things, make another method
    - Keep each method small... This helps with maintainence 
    - We are programming within the OOP paradigm. When in doubt, create a new class
    - Inheritance is our friend... use it
    - Keep the code organized
    - Use proper java domcumentation practices (see: https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/java/javadoc-tool.html)

    ###ABOUT THE PROJECT###
    - The file "levelinfo.txt" is where level information is stored
    - Gameboard, as of now, basically draws the floor design (this is the intended functionality)
